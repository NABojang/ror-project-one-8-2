This app ror-project-one-8-2 is to help travellers find information about countries and their cities. The app can be used to learn about statistics of countries and location of countries. The app is set to allow users to log in, when Logged in users can add, edit and delete countries or cities

There was a several problems I came across, one of the main Struggles I encountered during the project was, assigning each city to a specific country. I overcame this challenge by creating a creating a new model and create a new function with a city id, this id hence was used to connect the city to the desired country.

Ruby version
The version of ruby used for the app was 2.5.3. Reason been the other versions where not applicable hence updating the version of Ruby.
